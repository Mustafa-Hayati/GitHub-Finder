This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# GitHub Finder

I created this app using [Brad Traversy's](https://github.com/bradtraversy)  **REACT FRONT TO BACK 2019** course.
I also didn't deploy it to netlify,

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn`
3. Run `npm start` or `yarn start`

If you want to use this in development mode, you have to add **REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET** and **REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID** to your local environemt variables. If you want to deploy it make sure to add **GITHUB_CLIENT_ID** and **GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET** to the environment variables in the server.
You also need to run `npm run build` before deploying it.
